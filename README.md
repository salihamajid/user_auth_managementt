User Authentication and Management Web Application:
This project is a serverless web application designed for user registration, login, and session management. The frontend is built with React, using styled-components for styling, and the backend leverages Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions, along with Workers KV for data storage. The application focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly authentication system.

Features:
•	User Registration: New users can sign up with their name, email, and password. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored.
•	User Login: Existing users can log in with their email and password. The authentication process verifies the hashed password.
•	Session Management: User sessions are managed using tokens stored in the browser's localStorage.
•	Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
•	Black-and-White Theme: The application features a clean black-and-white theme for a modern and minimalistic look.

Technologies Used
Frontend
•	React: For building the user interface.
•	TypeScript: For type safety and improved developer experience.
•	React Router: For managing navigation within the app.
•	Styled Components: For component-level styling.
•	Zustand: For state management.
Backend
•	Cloudflare Workers: For running serverless functions that handle authentication and data processing.
•	Workers KV: For key-value data storage, used to store user information securely.
•	Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before storage to enhance security.
